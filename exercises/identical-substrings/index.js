// --- Directions
// Write a function that given a string S, returns an integer that represents
// the number of ways in which we can select a substring of S where all of the characters of
// the substring are identical.
// Two substrings with the same letters but different locations are still considered different.

// --- Examples
// identicalSubstr('zzzyz') => 8
// identicalSubstr('k') => 1

function countIdenticalSubstrings(S) {}

module.exports = countIdenticalSubstrings;
